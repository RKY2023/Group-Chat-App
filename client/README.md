Design a system where users can form their own groups like the way in whatsapp.
They should be able to name the group and Invite other users to join their group just the way it is like in whatsapp
Users should be able to see the groups they are a part of on the left side of the screen, so that they can switch between multiple groups easily.
Only people who are a part of the group should be able to see all the message that have been sent in the group.
Pay a lot of emphasis on DB Schema Design and try making the APIs as lightweight as possible.(No api should send a lot of data ). Try doing by yourself first,if stuck for long check hint
